The U.S. General Services Administration published an online resource list that references guidance prepared by various federal agencies on how to produce documents, software, videos, or websites according to government accessibility guidelines, thereby increasing the usability of digital content for everyone.

This archive contains the 63 PDF and Word documents referenced in the resource list posted as follows:

Using Section 508 Guidance to Improve the Accessibility of Government Services
http://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/06/05/using-section-508-guidance-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-government-services/

The document files have been renamed to correspond to their titles in the resource list.  The downloaded HTML file of the resource list is also included.  It explains the agency abbreviations that prefix each document title.

For official information on sharing the resource list, go to the Policies page of the DigitalGov site at 
http://www.digitalgov.gov/about/policies/
 On that page is a section called "Reuse & Copyright."
 
Basically, sharing is encouraged, though citation of DigitalGov and a link back to the source page are appreciated.  The purpose of the resource list is to disseminate free, objective information about how to make digital content accessible so that such practices become more common and inclusive.
